============================== Some Basics of Rest Framework =========================

Q. What is Rest Framework?
Ans: Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.

Some reasons you might want to use REST framework:

The Web browsable API is a huge usability win for your developers.
Authentication policies including packages for OAuth1a and OAuth2.
Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources.
Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if you don't need the more powerful features.
Extensive documentation, and great community support.
Used and trusted by internationally recognised companies including Mozilla, Red Hat, Heroku, and Eventbrite.

Q. What is Pagination ?

Ans.Pagination allows you to control how many objects per page are returned.
To enable it add the following lines to tutorial/settings.py

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS': 'rest_framework.pagination.PageNumberPagination',
    'PAGE_SIZE': 10
}

====================================== Requirements =================================
REST framework requires the following:

Python (3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
Django (3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 5.0)
We highly recommend and only officially support the latest patch release of each Python and Django series.

===================================== Installation ======================================

Install using pip, including any optional packages you want...

-pip install djangorestframework
-pip install markdown       # Markdown support for the browsable API.
-pip install django-filter  # Filtering support

Any global settings for a REST framework API are kept in a single configuration dictionary named REST_FRAMEWORK. Start off by adding the following to your settings.py module:

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    # Use Django's standard `django.contrib.auth` permissions,
    # or allow read-only access for unauthenticated users.
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.permissions.DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnonReadOnly'
    ]
}
Don't forget to make sure you've also added rest_framework to your INSTALLED_APPS.
